# Dart Learning Repository 🐦

Welcome! This is a personal Dart learning repository where I document my journey of understanding the Dart programming language — the language behind Flutter.

> ⚠ *Note: This is **not a complete Dart course*. I've only covered the Dart concepts that were necessary for me to start learning Flutter. If you're looking for a beginner-focused, practical introduction to Dart (without going too deep into every corner of the language), this might help you!
